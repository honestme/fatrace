0.12 (2016-04-25)
-----------------
 - Fix crash introdued in 0.10 when using the -p option. Thanks Yuriy M.
   Kaminski! (Debian #817247, LP: #1563919)

0.11 (2015-11-08)
-----------------
 - Make compatible with musl libc. Thanks Christian Neukirchen!
 - Add -C/--command option to only show events for a particular command. Thanks
   Christian Neukirchen!

0.10 (2015-04-29)
-----------------
 - Add --filter/-f option to only show selected event types. Thanks to Bryce
   Nesbitt!

0.9 (2014-11-07)
----------------
 - power-usage-report: Adjust parsing to also work for powertop 2.6.

0.8 (2014-09-23)
----------------
 - The previous O_LARGEFILE change to fix "Value too large for defined data
   type" error was ineffective, as in userspace this value is 0 on the affected
   platforms. Use the real numeric value to work around the problem for systems
   which run an older kernel that does not yet have the real fix.
   (LP: #1372873)

0.7 (2014-08-07)
----------------
 - Use O_LARGEFILE to fix "Value too large for defined data type" error with
   large files on some platforms. (LP: #1161989)
 - Increase buffer size to 256 KiB. (LP: #1312095)

0.6 (2014-01-07)
----------------
Bug fixes:
 - More careful check of uninteresting mount points, only consider those with a
   '/' in it. Thanks Heinrich Schuchardt!
 - power-usage-report: Fix output parsing for PowerTOP 2.5. (LP: #1265142)

0.5 (2013-04-11)
----------------
Improvements:
 - Some code optimizations, thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - power-usage-report: Use current powertop 2 (LP: #937703)
 - power-usage-report: Use Python 3
 - power-usage-report: Include "Process Device Activity" section from powertop

0.4 (2012-02-21)
----------------
Improvements:
 - Add power-usage-report script which uses fatrace and powertop-1.13 to
   collect data about file accesses, wakeups, and device stats and generates a
   developer/power-user oriented report which can be used for identifying power
   usage problems.

0.3 (2012-02-17)
----------------
Bug fixes:
 - Fix --ignore-pid short option (-p, not -i) in --help.
 - Tell apart closing for reading ("C") and closing for writing ("CW"). Point
   this out in the manpage.

0.2 (2012-02-15)
----------------
Improvements:
 - --output does not overwrite already existing files.
 - Some code cleanup and robustification, thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - Proper handling of Control-C (SIGINT), thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - When specifying --timestamp twice, print time as seconds since epoch, which
   is easier for automatic post-processing.

Bug fixes:
 - Listen to "close" events as well.
 - Simplify and robustify determination of path names. This also fixes the
   races which led to many events being shown with device/inode only.

0.1 (2012-02-07)
----------------
Initial version.
